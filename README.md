# QuadTree Terrain

Terrain addon using quadtree algorithm to split plane into uneven chunks, to take the advantage of frustum culling.


## About

This terrain implementation is designed for medium sized terrain (4x4km), with main focus being mobile games.

There is no built-in heightmap editor and it is not planned, I want to keep this addon as small as possible.
